# Musical-Structure-App
This app was a project submission for Udacity's Android Basics NanoDegree, A simple app demonstrating a multi screen activity for android.  This application is not complete as far as functionality is concerned.  The intent during creation of this app was to on focus on the overall structure and navigation functionality only.
